### Hello! I'm going to introduce myself and my interests ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**vanesaosu/vanesaosu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I am a person who likes to learn. The world of programming excites me and I would like to continue growing in knowledge every day. I am open to learning more programming languages.
I am currently looking for my first job.
The languages â€‹â€‹I already know are: HTML, CSS, JS, MYSQL, DJANGO AND PYTHON.
Right now I am learning the language of JAVA.
